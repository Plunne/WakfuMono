# Dear Bontarians!

As an experienced governor, with ecology in my earth and attached to great values, during this mandate, my goal is to introduce politic and ecology features to the new generation SINGLE-ACCOUNT.

Before the begining of this server, we will create guides to explain how the eco-system works.

Events will come in second time.

Every government members will be selected over important abilities like motivation, patriotism and knowledges of the features.

# I.Ecology

## 1.1 - Helping Guides
Guides will be available on a GitHub repo to help you introduce novice players to the features with just sharing a link. It will contain for exemple : Why becoming a bandit and how to avoid it?

## 1.2 - Sensibilisation Campaign
A campaign will be instaured and will require involvement of some of you that want to cruise arround the map to share the Helping Guides and tips.

## 1.3 - Anti-Ecoterrorism Raids
Party will be organized to restore territories bonuses and face of eco-terrorism.

# II. Politic

## 2.1 - Politic Lessons

Frequently, before a territory became a PvP battlefield, the money will be transfered and saved into a safe one.

## 2.3 - Weather Management
To help job farmers, weather will be supervised to keep best plantation rates.

For those who wants to level up with challenges, we will do our best to ensure you'll always have something to do.

## 3.1 - Bonta Army
The Bonta soldiers program will consist of meeting our best players to classify them. It will allows us to call them for some help to defend against exterior menace.

## 3.2 - Bonta Guard
We will need the involvment of our best players to defend. For those who want to serve, You will get a role that will indicate that you are available for urgency defense when online, e.g. when a low level see an high level bandit in a territory, you'll have to arrest him.

## 3.3 - Actuality
At the end of each month, we will celebrate our best player, every bontarians that finished in the top 3 of a dungeon ladder and the PvP top 10. (Take it like star program)

This is a list of events possible, it's virtual and suggestions are welcome :
- Blind tests
- Musical chairs
- Prop Hunt

- Cruises

And others...

# V. Mentoring

The mentoring is le last most important point I wanted to talk about. In order to preserve a great atmosphere and to advance together, I suggest to every bontarians, taking sometime the time to return to low level zones to initiate and invite novices to contribute at the life of Bonta.

# VI. Announcements

Announcements will be regulary sent at Bonta to inform players of our nation activity.

# VII. Conclusion

To conclude, like other motivated people says :

I'll support Bonta to the end.
If the Single-Player has 50k players, I'm one of them.
If the Single-Player has only one player, It's me.
If the world is against the Single-Player, Then I'm against the world.
Finally, if the Single-Player is empty, It's because I'm dead.

Long live Bonta!!!
