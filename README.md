# WakfuMono 

Hi! :Bonta: 

I'm a long time experienced gouvernor in Wakfu on french servers and would present to you my election program to you.

As you can know, there are no many politicians and ecologist in this game and you'll rarely find frenchies that want to duplicate everything in english. That's what i'll do.

I think the best way to get a great gouvernor is to have one that can communicate in both english and french because the french community is the most populate part of the community. Then it's your chance to participate and contribute to every activities of your nation.

Sorry for those who ain't Bonta, I would like to do the same thing for other nations but I'm not Naruto. :ninja: 

In this last month before the server opening, I'll prepare the best events and activities that I could and I need your help to realize it.

Then, after my weeks as gouvernor, there will be many peoples introduced to the politic and ecology features, that's my goal, these features are so underrated, not used, so we have to change that.

Thanks to everyone for your support! :heart: 

Plunne
